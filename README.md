SkyWarden is a computer-vision system that detects military aircraft in aerial images, classifies each as friendly or enemy, and raises an alert the moment a hostile aircraft is spotted.

## Objective

SkyWarden demonstrates how modern computer vision can automatically detect and classify military aircraft from aerial imagery while providing an immediate friend-or-enemy assessment for situational awareness. It combines a YOLOv8 detector, a Segment-Anything-assisted labeling pipeline, and a Streamlit front end into a single end-to-end demo — from raw aerial imagery to an annotated, alert-triggering result.

## Architecture

```

Detection and classification happen in a single YOLOv8 pass (one model predicts both the box and the aircraft type); the friend/enemy step is a separate rule-based lookup against the static allegiance lists in `app.py`. See [How It Works](#how-it-works) for the full pipeline, including preprocessing and training.

## Features

- **Aircraft detection** — locates aircraft in an aerial image and draws bounding boxes with class name and confidence score.
- **77-class recognition** — recognizes 77 distinct aircraft types, from fighters and bombers to transports and UAVs.
- **Friend/enemy classification** — cross-references each detected type against a curated allegiance list and colors boxes accordingly (green = friend, red = enemy, white = unrecognized).
- **Real-time alerts** — surfaces a clear on-screen warning the moment any enemy aircraft is detected.
- **Web interface** — drag-and-drop image upload via Streamlit, no setup beyond installing dependencies.
- **Reproducible training pipeline** — scripts to go from raw labeled data to a trained YOLOv8 checkpoint, including SAM-assisted auto-labeling.

## Demo

| Sample input | Model validation predictions |
|---|---|
| ![Sample aircraft image](images/sample_f16.jpg) | ![Validation batch predictions](results/val_batch0_pred.jpg) |

More raw sample inputs are in `images/`. Full evaluation plots and validation prediction grids from training are in `results/`. Note the grid above is YOLO's standard per-class training visualization — the live app's actual output uses green/red boxes for the friend/enemy call instead.

> If these don't render wherever you're previewing this file, it's because `images/` and `results/` need to sit alongside the README — the paths are relative to the repo, not broken links.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip (or conda)
- A CUDA-capable GPU is recommended for training, but not required for running the app with a pre-trained checkpoint

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashishsps20/SkyWarden.git
cd SkyWarden
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` covers both the app and the preprocessing/training scripts.

### Model Weights

Trained weights aren't checked into the repo (see `.gitignore`). Download them from the link in the `model` file and note the local path.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
YOLO_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/your/trained/model.pt
```

### Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the local URL Streamlit prints (typically `http://localhost:8501`), upload an aerial image, and view the annotated result.

## How It Works

1. **Label preparation** — `dataset_split_preprocessing.py` converts the dataset's CSV bounding-box annotations into YOLO-format `.txt` labels and splits the data 70/20/10 into train/val/test.
2. **Auto-labeling (optional)** — `SAM_Bounding_Box.py` runs Meta's Segment Anything Model over unlabeled images and converts the resulting masks into YOLO-format boxes.
3. **Classification data prep** — `crop_preprocessing.py` restructures a folder of cropped, per-class aircraft images into the same YOLO layout (one full-image box per crop) for a classification-style fine-tuning pass.
4. **Training** — `Full_Frame_Train.py` trains YOLOv8 on full aerial frames for 20 epochs; `full_frame_freeze_train.py` resumes from a checkpoint with the first 20 layers frozen for 10 more epochs; `crop_classification_train.py` fine-tunes the same way on cropped images.
5. **Inference** — `app.py` loads the trained checkpoint, runs detection on the uploaded image, and checks each predicted class name against two static allegiance lists (`friend_classes`, `enemy_classes`) to color-code boxes and trigger the enemy-detected alert.

## Dataset

Trained on the [Military Aircraft Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/a2015003713/militaryaircraftdetectiondataset/data) from Kaggle — 77 labeled aircraft classes spanning fighters, bombers, transports, helicopters, and UAVs, used for both detection (full frame) and classification (cropped) training.

## Results

Training ran for 20 epochs on the full-frame detector. These are approximate values read from the training curves in `results/results.png`, not exact logged metrics — see `results/` for the full confusion matrix and PR/F1 curves.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Precision | ~0.78 |
| Recall | ~0.69 |
| mAP@50 | ~0.76 |
| mAP@50–95 | ~0.70 |
| Classes | 77 |

## Known Limitations

- **Dependencies aren't version-pinned** — `requirements.txt` lists packages without specific versions; pin them once you've confirmed a working set.
- **No license file** — see [License](#license).
- **Hardcoded paths** — the preprocessing and training scripts use local Windows paths (`C:\arpan\...`) and Kaggle paths (`/kaggle/working/...`) that need updating before running elsewhere.
- **Class-name mismatch** — `app.py`'s `friend_classes` list includes `"FA18"`, while `dataset_split_preprocessing.py`'s `CLASS_NAMES` uses `"F18"` for the same aircraft. Worth confirming against your trained model's actual `model.names` so F/A-18 detections aren't miscategorized as "Unknown."
- **Static allegiance list** — friend/enemy status is a hardcoded lookup in `app.py`, not a learned or configurable property; relabeling an aircraft means editing source code.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Pin versions in `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Move `friend_classes` / `enemy_classes` into an external config (JSON/YAML)
- [ ] Add batch and video/stream inference
- [ ] Add automated tests for the preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Containerize with Docker for easier setup
- [ ] Publish a versioned model release instead of a Drive link
- [ ] Expose detection through a REST API
- [ ] Export the model to ONNX for broader deployment options
